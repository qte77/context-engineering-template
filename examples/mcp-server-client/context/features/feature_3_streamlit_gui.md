# Feature description for: Streamlit GUI for MCP Server-Client Interaction Showcase

## FEATURE

Develop a **Streamlit-based graphical user interface (GUI)** to demonstrate and interactively showcase the communication and integration between the MCP Server and MCP Client. The GUI should allow users to:

* Select and invoke any of the three available tools (`roll_dice`, `get_weather`, `get_date`) via intuitive form inputs.
* Enter tool-specific parameters such as dice notation, location, or timezone.
* Display real-time request payloads sent by the client and the corresponding responses received from the server.
* Handle and display error messages gracefully.
* Log interaction history for the current session, allowing users to review previous commands and results.
* Provide clear visual feedback about the status of the connection and request execution.

This GUI acts as both a testing ground and demonstration interface, useful for users unfamiliar with command-line tools or raw protocol messages.

## EXAMPLES

Located in `/context/examples`:

* `streamlit_roll_dice_interaction.json`: Example input/output pairs demonstrating a dice roll session in the GUI.
* `streamlit_get_weather_interaction.json`: Demonstrates user inputs for location and the displayed weather response.
* `streamlit_get_date_interaction.json`: Shows date/time requests with optional timezone selection.
* `streamlit_error_handling.json`: Examples of how the GUI displays server-side validation errors or connection issues.

These examples serve as test cases for GUI input validation and response rendering.

## DOCUMENTATION

* [Streamlit Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/) for building interactive Python apps.
* \[MCP Server and Client Protocol Specs] (internal/proprietary or from context-engineering-intro).
* Python libraries for HTTP or socket communication used by the client.
* UI/UX design best practices for interactive demos.
* [context-engineering-intro](https://github.com/coleam00/context-engineering-intro) for project conventions.

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

* Ensure asynchronous or non-blocking communication so the UI remains responsive during server interactions.
* Validate inputs in the GUI before sending to the client to minimize server errors.
* Provide helpful tooltips or inline help to explain tool parameters to users unfamiliar with dice notation or timezone formats.
* Consider session state management in Streamlit to maintain history and status.
* AI coding assistants often overlook proper error propagation to the UI and user-friendly messaging.
* Security considerations: if exposing any sensitive endpoints or API keys, avoid hardcoding secrets in the GUI code.
* Design with extensibility in mind to add new tools or more complex workflows easily.
