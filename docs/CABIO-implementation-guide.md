# CABIO Implementation Guide

Technical specifications and implementation requirements for Context-Aware Business Intelligence Orchestration

## Phase Completion Criteria

### Phase 1: Native Sub-Agent Configuration

- [ ] Sub-agents respond correctly to structured business input
- [ ] Context isolation prevents information leakage between agents
- [ ] Agent handover mechanism functional (output → input validation)

### Phase 2: Context Engineering System

- [ ] Context filtering demonstrates improved relevance vs baseline
- [ ] Information preservation validated through test scenarios
- [ ] Tool hooks execute reliably without blocking workflows

### Phase 3: MCP Business Intelligence Integration

- [ ] MCP servers connect and return validated business data
- [ ] API rate limits and error handling implemented
- [ ] Data quality validation passes for all external sources

### Phase 4-8: Advanced Phases

- [ ] Define specific completion benchmarks for each remaining phase

## Risk Mitigation & Dependency Management

### External Dependencies

- [ ] **Claude Code Changes**: Implement fallback to custom command architecture
- [ ] **MCP Server Downtime**: Deploy template-based analysis fallback mode
- [ ] **API Rate Limits**: Implement graceful degradation and request queuing
- [ ] **Vendor Lock-in**: Design multi-provider support architecture

### Data Security & Privacy

#### Data Retention Policies

- [ ] Customer data purging: 30/90/365-day lifecycle management
- [ ] Market research data anonymization protocols
- [ ] Competitive intelligence data sourcing compliance

#### Customer Data Protection

- [ ] Pilot customer data isolation mechanisms
- [ ] Business input confidentiality guarantees
- [ ] Output data ownership and portability standards

#### Compliance Requirements

- [ ] GDPR compliance for EU business data processing
- [ ] SOC2 Type II certification preparation
- [ ] Industry-specific compliance (healthcare, finance)

## Resource Requirements & Scaling

### Infrastructure Cost Estimates

- [ ] **Compute Requirements**: Define cost per business analysis
- [ ] **Storage Scaling**: Database size projections and archival strategy
- [ ] **API Costs**: Budget for Claude, external data sources, MCP servers

### Scaling Specifications

- [ ] **Individual User**: Support for monthly analysis volume
- [ ] **Small Team (10 people)**: Concurrent analysis capacity
- [ ] **Enterprise (100+ people)**: High-availability architecture requirements

## User Experience Specifications

### Minimum Viable Product Definition

- [ ] **Core Flow**: Business input → Template-based analysis → Structured BRD output
- [ ] **Performance Target**: Complete analysis workflow in reasonable timeframe
- [ ] **Quality Standard**: Output provides structured business framework
- [ ] **Usability Requirement**: Minimal learning curve for business users

### Target User Story

**Sarah runs a 10-person SaaS startup. She uploads a business idea document, uses the structured BRD generation workflow, reviews the generated business framework with template-based market analysis, then exports to preferred format - ready for team discussion with professional business structure.**

### User Interface Requirements

- [ ] Intuitive business input form with guided prompts
- [ ] Real-time progress tracking during analysis phases
- [ ] Interactive BRD review and editing capabilities
- [ ] Multiple export formats (PDF, Notion, Google Docs)

### Integration Specifications

- [ ] **CRM Systems**: Salesforce and HubSpot data import
- [ ] **Project Management**: Notion and Linear workflow integration
- [ ] **Document Platforms**: Google Docs and Confluence compatibility

## Success Metrics & Validation

### User Experience Metrics

- [ ] Business user completes analysis without training (success rate >90%)
- [ ] Analysis completion time reasonable for small teams (target: 2-4 hours for comprehensive BRD)
- [ ] User satisfaction score >4.5/5 for generated BRDs

### Business Value Metrics

- [ ] Generated BRDs lead to successful product outcomes (6-month follow-up)
- [ ] Cost savings vs manual analysis or consulting services
- [ ] Time-to-market improvement for product development

### Competitive Performance

- [ ] Demonstrably faster than manual analysis (>5x speed improvement)
- [ ] Quality parity or superior to existing business intelligence tools
- [ ] Lower total cost of ownership than traditional BI solutions

## Implementation Roadmap Extensions

### Phase 1 Enhancements

- [ ] MVP scope definition and success criteria establishment
- [ ] User experience design and mockup creation
- [ ] Dependency fallback strategy implementation

### Technical Architecture Additions

- [ ] Infrastructure cost modeling and budget allocation
- [ ] Security and privacy compliance framework
- [ ] Third-party integration requirement specifications

### Market Readiness Requirements

- [ ] Production deployment strategy and infrastructure
- [ ] International market technical considerations (regulatory, compliance)
- [ ] API ecosystem architecture for third-party developers
