# CABIO Product Roadmap

What we're building and the value it delivers

## Value Proposition

**Enhanced business analysis templates for small teams (5-25 people), evolving toward intelligent orchestration.**

CABIO transforms the current template-based BRD→PRD→FRP workflow through agent orchestration and context compression - starting with enhanced templates (8-12 weeks), building toward comprehensive business intelligence automation (12+ months).
